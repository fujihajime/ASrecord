# Video Generation

## Subject
- **Two swimmers** actively descending through underwater cave
- **Movement**: Continuous downward gliding from upper-left to lower-right corner
- **Formation**: Side-by-side synchronized descent
- **Posture**: Streamlined diving position, arms extended forward
- **Physics**: Bodies show natural water resistance, flowing hair and fabric

## Environment  
- **Setting**: Deep blue underwater cave at 50-meter depth
- **Lighting**: Natural light filtering from above, creating god rays
- **Water**: Clear visibility with floating particles (marine snow)
- **Walls**: Textured rocky cave surfaces

## Camera
- **Type**: Tracking shot following swimmers during descent
- **Angle**: Fixed perspective maintaining subjects in frame
- **Movement**: Camera follows diagonal trajectory with subjects

## Physics & Effects
- **Water dynamics**: Realistic flow around moving bodies
- **Bubble generation**: Natural bubble streams from breathing
- **Hair/fabric**: Flowing naturally with water resistance
- **Particle interaction**: Marine snow drifting around subjects

## Audio Requirements
### INCLUDE:
- Muffled underwater acoustics
- Gentle bubbling from breathing
- Soft water movement sounds
- Cave environment echo

### **PROHIBITED**:
- **NO human voices**
- **NO narration** 
- **NO music**
- **NO surface sounds**

## Duration
- **Length**: 8-10 seconds of continuous movement
