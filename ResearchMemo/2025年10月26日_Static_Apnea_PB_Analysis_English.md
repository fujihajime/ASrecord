## ⚠️ Critical Disclaimer ⚠️

### **DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME**

Static apnea carries serious risks including:

- **Blackout (loss of consciousness)**: Can occur suddenly without warning, leading to drowning
- **Samba (shallow loss of consciousness)**: Convulsion-like muscle movements, precursor to blackout
- **Hypoxic brain injury**: Risk of irreversible brain damage
- **Cardiovascular stress**: Rapid fluctuations in heart rate and blood pressure

**Freediving principle**: "Never dive alone"

## Executive Summary

### Performance Records
- **1998 (age 24) PB**: 2:20
- **2025 (age 51) PB**: 2:45
- **27-year improvement**: +25 seconds (18% increase)

### Optimal Conditions
Post-practice + women's high-cut competition swimsuit + pre-masturbation timing

### Key Discoveries
1. **Discovery of 3-generation hereditary weak iliopsoas muscles**
   - Grandmother, mother, uncle: Thin body type + protruding lower abdomen + leg problems in later life
   - Author: Became overweight rapidly in 4th grade (experienced 96kg period) + protruding lower abdomen since middle school + leg problems
   - Common factor is not body size but "weak iliopsoas → visceral ptosis → protruding lower abdomen → leg problems in later life" as a physiological characteristic

2. **Understanding of visceral ptosis mechanism**
   - Weak iliopsoas → pelvic instability → visceral ptosis → diaphragm compression → lung capacity restriction

3. **Discovery of high-cut swimsuit comfort since middle school**
   - Late 1980s, already recognized comfort of women's high-cut competition swimsuits during middle school
   - Protruding lower abdomen already present at that time, swimsuit external compression provided physical comfort
   - Consistent comfort experience spanning over 35 years

4. **Triple optimization mechanism**
   - (1) Internal activation through practice (clear iliopsoas training instruction from October 19, 2025)
   - (2) External support from women's high-cut swimsuit (over 35 years of proven experience since middle school)
   - (3) Neural state pre-masturbation (possible parasympathetic dominance)

## Discovery Phases

### Middle School Era: Discovery of High-Cut Swimsuit Comfort (Late 1980s)

**Background**:
- Already wearing women's high-cut competition swimsuits during middle school
- Protruding lower abdomen already present at that time

**Important realization**:
- **Women's high-cut competition swimsuits felt abnormally comfortable**
- Sensation of reduced pressure on lower abdomen
- Did not understand why it was so comfortable at the time

**Duration**:
- Approximately 35+ years of continuous experience from middle school (late 1980s) to present
- Recognition of consistent comfort beyond mere "preference"

**Significance**:
- Longest-term physical comfort experience in 46-year aquaphilia history
- Strong evidence suggesting physical necessity rather than sexual preference

---

### Phase 1 (1993-1998, age 18-24): Pre-practice "activity" discovery period

**Background**:
- Began intentional static apnea measurement
- Observed performance variation under various conditions

**Accidental discovery**:
- Noticed that pre-practice masturbation improved static apnea performance
- Understanding at the time: "Maybe because blood flow improves?"
- Physiological mechanism remained unknown

**Result**:
- Achieved PB 2:20 in 1998 (age 24)
- However, did not understand why it was effective

---

### Phase 2 (May-October 2024, age 50): Overtraining and awareness phase

**Overtraining period**:
- Weight decreased to 73kg
- Fatigue, reduced immunity, blood sugar instability
- Reactive hypoglycemia symptoms (sudden drowsiness/weakness 2 hours after meals)

**Mysterious discovery**:
- **Lower abdomen protruded even at 73kg**
- "Isn't it subcutaneous fat?"
- "Why does only the lower abdomen stand out despite weight loss?"
- Re-recognized pattern of protruding lower abdomen continuing since middle school

**Beginning of awareness**:
- Remembered that grandmother, mother, and uncle shared the same characteristics
- Grandmother: Thin body + protruding lower abdomen + hip joint problems in later life
- Mother: Thin body + protruding lower abdomen + knee/ankle problems in later life
- Uncle: Thin body + protruding lower abdomen + leg problems in later life
- **Author**: Overweight since 4th grade (experienced 96kg period) + protruding lower abdomen since middle school + leg problems

**Hypothesis formation**:
- This might not be subcutaneous fat but visceral ptosis
- Something hereditary might be involved
- Is this why high-cut swimsuits felt comfortable since middle school?

---

### Phase 3 (October 19, 2025, age 51): Clear iliopsoas training instruction from coach

**Trigger**:
- October 19, 2025: Clear iliopsoas training instruction from artistic swimming coach
- Content focused on strengthening iliopsoas muscles

**Prescribed training menu**:
1. **Jumping jacks**: 30-40 reps
2. **Squats**: 10 reps
3. **Push-ups**: 5-10 reps (currently doing 3)
4. **Resistance band iliopsoas training**: 15°, 45° angles
5. **Leg raises**: 20 reps
6. **Plié with buttock squeeze**: No rep specification

**Important realization**:
- **Plié with buttock squeeze position felt abnormally comfortable**
- Sensation of reduced pressure on lower abdomen
- Later understood: This position activated iliopsoas and lifted organs internally
- Noticed similarity with swimsuit comfort since middle school

---

### Phase 4 (October 25-26, 2025, age 51): Integration and complete understanding phase

**Integration through AI dialogue**:
- Initial question: "Slip-resistant gloves for wall handstand practice on slippery flooring"
- Consultation on training decisions when fatigued
- Analysis of blood sugar management and health history
- **Discovery of hereditary weak iliopsoas muscles** (3 generations)

**Reaching complete understanding**:
1. **Hereditary weak iliopsoas**: Grandmother → mother → author (and uncle)
2. **Visceral ptosis mechanism**: Weak iliopsoas → pelvic instability → visceral ptosis
3. **Impact on diaphragm**: Visceral ptosis → diaphragm compression → lung capacity restriction
4. **Role of women's high-cut swimsuit**: External compression → visceral lift → diaphragm release
5. **Reason for comfort since middle school**: Visceral ptosis already present, swimsuit compression provided physical comfort
6. **Comfort of plié position**: Iliopsoas activation → lifting organs internally
7. **Effect of pre-practice "activity"**: Blood flow + iliopsoas activation, now replaced by warm-up
8. **Post-practice, pre-masturbation timing**: Possible parasympathetic nervous system dominance

**Integrated understanding of triple optimization**:
- (1) **Internal activation through practice**: Iliopsoas training (clear instruction from October 19, 2025)
- (2) **External support from women's high-cut swimsuit**: Over 35 years of proven experience from middle school (late 1980s), similar function to pelvic belt/corset
- (3) **Neural state pre-masturbation**: Optimal balance of relaxation and concentration

## Role and Significance of Women's High-Cut Competition Swimsuits

### Aquaphilia Community Context

**Conventional perception**: Merely sexual preference/fetishism

**New hypothesis**: **Possibility of physical necessity**

A strong preference lasting 46 years, especially consistent comfort spanning over 35 years since middle school, may not be just an "unusual hobby" but possibly unconscious recognition that the body reaches optimal state.

### Over 35 Years of Proven Experience

**Middle school era (late 1980s)**:
- Already recognized comfort of women's high-cut competition swimsuits
- Protruding lower abdomen already present at that time
- Did not understand why it was comfortable, but the body knew

**Present (2025)**:
- Unchanged comfort even after 35+ years
- Finally understanding the physiological reason
- Possibility of "physical necessity" rather than mere "preference"

### External Compression Mechanism

**Similar function to pelvic belt/corset**:
- Appropriate compression around pelvis
- Pelvic stabilization
- Physical support for organ positioning

**Visceral lift effect**:
- Temporary lifting of prolapsed organs (stomach, intestines, etc.)
- Reduced pressure on lower abdomen
- Approximation to normal organ arrangement

**Diaphragm compression relief**:
- Lifting of organs reduces downward pressure on diaphragm
- Expanded diaphragm range of motion
- **Maximization of lung capacity**

### Visual and Tactile Feedback

**Impact on nervous system**:
- Visual recognition of swimsuit → psychological relaxation?
- Body fit sensation → tactile feedback
- Conscious/unconscious recognition of "optimal state"

**Possibilities**:
- Activation of parasympathetic nervous system
- Reduction of stress response
- Optimal balance of concentration and relaxation

---

## Physiological Analysis

### Iliopsoas and Pelvic Stability

**What is Iliopsoas**:
- **Psoas major** + **Iliacus**
- Deep abdominal muscle group
- Connects from lower spine through pelvis to femur

**Primary functions**:
1. **Hip flexion**: Lifting legs forward
2. **Anterior pelvic tilt maintenance**: Maintaining appropriate pelvic angle
3. **Spinal stabilization**: Maintaining torso posture
4. **Walking/running**: Generating propulsion

**Impact of weakness**:
- Pelvic destabilization
- Postural collapse (compensatory movement patterns)
- Reduced visceral support
- Excessive load on other muscle groups

---

### Visceral Ptosis Mechanism

**Process**:
1. **Weak iliopsoas** → reduced pelvic floor muscle support
2. **Gravitational influence** → downward movement of organs (stomach, intestines, etc.)
3. **Pressure on lower abdomen** → visible protrusion (not subcutaneous fat)
4. **Pressure on diaphragm** → upward push from below
5. **Reduced respiratory efficiency** → restricted diaphragm range of motion

**Reason for lower abdomen protrusion even at 73kg**:
- Visceral ptosis remains even when subcutaneous fat decreases
- Abnormal organ positioning is independent of body weight
- Won't improve without strengthening iliopsoas

**Consistency from middle school to present**:
- Middle school: Protruding lower abdomen + discovered swimsuit comfort
- 96kg period: Protruding lower abdomen continued
- 73kg period: Protruding lower abdomen despite weight loss
- Current 84kg: Protruding lower abdomen continues
- **Common element**: Visceral ptosis, not body weight

**3-generation common pattern**:
- Grandmother, mother, uncle: Protruding lower abdomen despite thin body type
- Author: Overweight since 4th grade (experienced 96kg period), protruding lower abdomen since middle school
- **Common factor**: Not body type but weak iliopsoas → visceral ptosis → protruding lower abdomen

**Leg problems in later life**:
- Weak iliopsoas → compensatory movement patterns (compensating with other muscles)
- Excessive load on hip joints, knees, ankles
- Long-term joint wear and pain

---

### Diaphragm and Respiratory Mechanics

**Diaphragm**:
- Muscular partition separating thoracic and abdominal cavities
- Primary respiratory muscle (responsible for 70-80% of breathing)

**Normal breathing mechanism**:
1. **Inhalation**: Diaphragm contracts and moves downward → thoracic cavity expands → air flows into lungs
2. **Exhalation**: Diaphragm relaxes and moves upward → thoracic cavity contracts → air expelled from lungs

**Impact of visceral ptosis**:
- Prolapsed organs compress diaphragm from below
- Downward movement of diaphragm is restricted
- Insufficient thoracic expansion during inhalation
- **Reduced lung capacity**

**Effect of women's high-cut swimsuit**:
1. External compression → visceral lift
2. Reduced compression on diaphragm
3. Expanded diaphragm range of motion
4. **Improved lung capacity**
5. **Extended static apnea duration**

---

## Triple Optimization Mechanism

### (1) Internal Activation Through Practice

**Clear instruction from October 19, 2025**:
- Clear iliopsoas training instruction from coach
- Jumping jacks, squats: Overall lower body activation
- Resistance band iliopsoas training: Direct iliopsoas strengthening
- Leg raises: Integrated strengthening of iliopsoas + abdominal muscles
- **Plié with buttock squeeze**: Iliopsoas activation + pelvic stabilization

**Reason for plié position comfort**:
- Iliopsoas activates and lifts organs internally
- Reduced pressure sensation on lower abdomen
- Decreased pressure on diaphragm
- **Easier breathing**
- Same mechanism as swimsuit comfort since middle school

**Function as warm-up**:
- Pre-practice training → iliopsoas activation
- Temporary visceral lift
- Starting practice in optimal breathing state

---

### (2) External Support from Women's High-Cut Swimsuit

**Over 35 years of proven experience**:
- From middle school (late 1980s) to present
- Consistent physical comfort
- Possibility of physical necessity rather than sexual preference

**Physical mechanism**:
- Appropriate compression around pelvis (similar to pelvic belt/corset)
- High-cut design → direct pressure on lower abdomen
- Physical support for organs

**Effects**:
1. **Visceral lift**: Lifting prolapsed organs
2. **Diaphragm release**: Expanded range of motion through reduced compression
3. **Lung capacity maximization**: Improved respiratory efficiency
4. **Comfort**: Reduced pressure sensation on lower abdomen

**Why "women's" and "high-cut"?**:
- Women's design: Leg openings at higher position (optimized pelvic compression)
- High-cut: Coverage and compression of lower abdomen
- Men's styles may not achieve equivalent effect

---

### (3) Neural State Pre-Masturbation

**Note**: This section contains much speculation without medical verification

**Hypothesis**:
- Pre-masturbation state = early stage of sexual arousal
- Changes in neurotransmitters: dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline
- **Possible parasympathetic nervous system activation**

**Characteristics of parasympathetic dominance**:
- Heart rate stabilization
- Deepened breathing
- Muscle relaxation
- Improved concentration

**Impact on static apnea**:
- Relaxation → reduced oxygen consumption
- Concentration → improved mental endurance
- Heart rate stability → efficient oxygen utilization

**Why "pre"?**:
- "Post" involves fatigue/drowsiness (refractory period)
- "Pre" provides optimal balance of arousal and relaxation

**Important note**:
- This is speculation based on personal observation
- Insufficient scientific evidence
- Other factors (placebo effect, etc.) are highly possible

## Performance Data

### Static Apnea Under Normal Conditions

**Conditions**:
- No special preparation
- Daily clothing/state
- Measured at spontaneous timing

**Results**:
- **Range**: 30 seconds ~ 1 minute 10 seconds
- **Average performance**
- Within standard range for adult males

---

### Static Apnea Under Optimal Conditions

**Conditions**:
- Post-practice (iliopsoas training completed)
- Wearing women's high-cut competition swimsuit
- Pre-masturbation timing

**Results**:
- **Range**: 2 minutes 30 seconds ~ 2 minutes 45 seconds
- **October 2025 PB**: 2 minutes 45 seconds (age 51)

**Comparison with normal conditions**:
- At least 2x improvement (30 seconds → 2:30)
- Up to 3x improvement (1:10 → 2:45)

---

### Historical Comparison

| Year | Age | Record | Conditions | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1998 | 24 | 2:20 | Pre-practice "activity" + swimsuit (presumed) | Young adult PB, no mechanism understanding |
| 2025 | 51 | 2:45 | Post-practice + swimsuit + timing | Age 51 PB, based on complete understanding |

**Improvement rate**: +25 seconds (18% increase)

**27-year gap**:
- Did not exceed this record from 1998 to 2025
- Clear iliopsoas training instruction on October 19, 2025 was turning point
- Achieved complete understanding and optimization on October 25-26, 2025

---

## Significance of PB Update at Age 51

### Why Does 51-Year-Old Outperform 24-Year-Old?

**Age 24 (1998) situation**:
- ❌ No mechanism understanding
- ❌ Accidental conditions
- ❌ Low reproducibility
- ❌ No optimization awareness
- ✅ Basic fitness from youth
- ✅ Swimsuit effect since middle school (unconscious)

**Age 51 (2025) situation**:
- ✅ Complete physiological understanding
- ✅ Intentional optimization
- ✅ Clear iliopsoas training instruction from coach (October 19, 2025)
- ✅ Conscious execution of triple optimization
- ✅ Reproducible condition setting
- ✅ Complete understanding of 35+ years of swimsuit effect experience
- ❌ Natural lung capacity decline from aging

**Conclusion**:
Knowledge and experience can compensate for and even exceed physical limitations.

---

### Impact of Aging?

**General aging effects**:
- Natural lung capacity decline (approximately 1% per year)
- Age 24 to 51: Expected approximately 27% decrease
- Muscle strength decline
- Recovery capacity decline

**However**:
- Intentional training (clear iliopsoas strengthening instruction from October 19, 2025)
- Optimization based on physiological understanding
- Conscious condition management
- Accumulated understanding of 35+ years of swimsuit effect

**These not only compensated for age-related decline but produced results exceeding youth**
